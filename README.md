I'm a student at **ITMO University**, diving headfirst into the world of tech and code 🚀

- 🎓 Studying at the Faculty of Information Technologies and Programming
- 🤝 Always open to student collabs, creative projects, or just nerdy conversations
- 🔍 Learning by building, failing fast, and trying again
- 📬 Reach me via [email](garysina.vika@gmail.com) or on [Telegram](https://t.me/windless31)

🌱 _Every expert was once a beginner — and I'm loving every step of the climb._
